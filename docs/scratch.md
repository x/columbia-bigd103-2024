# Complete List of Exercises

All exercises will be completed in Google Colab Notebooks. The exercises will be started in class and, if necessary, completed as homework. The exercises will be based on the following topics:

**Basic Python Exercises in Google Colab Notebooks**

Students will complete a number of basic introductory exercises in Google Colab Notebooks. These exercises will be based on the following topics:

- Hello World
- Simple Calculator
- The Guessing Game
- The Fibonacci Sequence

**Building a Text Adventure Game**

Students will build a simple text adventure game in Python. This will be an exercise in using control flow, functions, and data structures. Later in the course, students will revisit this project to introduce Machine Learning concepts.

**CSV Data Analysis**

Students will work with CSV files to analyze data. This will be an exercise in using data structures and Pandas. Primarily, students will be working with housing data but, as we progress, we will introduce new datasets based on the interests of the students.

**Natural Language Processing with Music Lyrics**

Students will work with music lyrics to:

- Analyze sentiment
- Separate music by artist using TFIDF

**Time Series Data Analysis**

Students will work with time series data to predict future values. This will be an exercise in using linear regressions and will later be revisited to demonstrate train-test splits.

**Image Classification with Pytorch**

Students will use Pytorch to classify images. At least one exercise will involve classifying handwritten digits. The second exercise will depend on the interests of the students.
