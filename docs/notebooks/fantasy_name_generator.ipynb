It takes place in the mythical land of Aetheria. However, they have a problem, they're struggling to write names for their characters. Help them out by writing a function to generate some fantasy names.\n","\n","Below, I've provided three things:\n","\n","1. A list of `first_names` that would be fitting for a fantasy character in Aetheria.\n","2. A list of `last_names` that would be fitting for a fantasy character in Aetheria.\n","3. I've imported the function `randint` for you to help you choose random names from this list.\n","\n","## Assignment\n","\n","Write a function, `random_name` which chooses a random first name and a random last name and returns them as a String.\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","```py\n","print(random_name())\n","```\n","```\n","\"Thranduil Starfire\"\n","```\n","\n","**Extra**\n","- Add or change the names in the `first_names` and `last_names` list.\n","- Add epithets and job titles (i.e. \"Thranduil Starfire the Drunk Bard\")\n","- Have `random_name` return a list of names instead of a single name. If called without arguments, `random_name` should return a list with a single name. But if passed a number, it should return a list of that length. All names returned in the list MUST BE UNIQUE.\n","\n","\n","## How `randint` Works\n","\n","Here's the documentation on the `randint` function I've imported for you below:\n","```\n","randint(a, b) method of random.Random instance\n","    Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.\n","```\n","\n","If you'd like to read more about the `random` module, take a look at the [Python 3 Documentation](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/random.html)."],"metadata":{"id":"kiHw4YtoHJQ_"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":45,"metadata":{"id":"wG16TqjeGy-r","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719503076168,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":223,"user":{"displayName":"Devon Peticolas","userId":"01655597089936748753"}},"outputId":"531df35b-08a0-4474-c67c-4ba76152aa8b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Gandalf Starfire the Whimsical Knight',\n"," 'Gandalf Moonwhisper the Small Druid',\n"," 'Faramir Windwalker the Small Bard',\n"," 'Arwen the Bard the Drunk Druid',\n"," 'Elrond Nightshade the Tall Druid']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45}],"source":["# Here is some code to get you started...\n","\n","from random import randint\n","from random import choice\n","\n","first_names = [\"Arwen\", \"Elrond\", \"Galadriel\", \"Legolas\", \"Thranduil\", \"Eowyn\", \"Boromir\", \"Faramir\", \"Gandalf\", \"Celeborn\"]\n","last_names = [\"Stormrider\", \"Shadowhunter\", \"Moonwhisper\", \"Nightshade\", \"Dragonbane\", \"Ironfist\", \"Brightblade\", \"Windwalker\", \"Starfire\", \"the Bard\"]\n","epithets = [\"Drunk\", \"Whimsical\", \"Tall\", \"Small\", \"Singing\"]\n","jobs = [\"Bard\", \"Knight\", \"Wizard\", \"Druid\"]\n","\n","def random_name(times=1):\n","    names = []\n","    for i in range(times):\n","        random_first_name = first_names[randint(0, len(first_names) - 1)]\n","        random_last_name = last_names[randint(0, len(last_names) - 1)]\n","        random_epithet = epithets[randint(0, len(epithets) - 1)]\n","        random_job = choice(jobs)\n","        random_name = f\"{random_first_name} {random_last_name} the {random_epithet} {random_job}\"\n","        if random_name not in names:\n","            names.append(random_name)\n","\n","    return names\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","random_name(5)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["foo = \"foo\"\n","bar = 10\n","my_new_str = f\"foo is {foo} bar is {bar}\"\n","my_new_str"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"6Bmattw1UsV1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719502607591,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":179,"user":{"displayName":"Devon Peticolas","userId":"01655597089936748753"}},"outputId":"95f56d3a-a894-4137-c850-6d74314ba3ff"},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'foo is foo bar is 10'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"cvia0JRBVqhj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
