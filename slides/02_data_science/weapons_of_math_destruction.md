# What is "a Model"?

---

## What is "a Model"?

- **Definition**: A model is a simplified representation of some aspect of reality, used to predict or make decisions about the future.
- **Purpose**: Models help us understand complex systems by focusing on key variables and relationships.
- **Examples**: Weather forecasts, financial projections, and educational evaluations.

---

## Characteristics of Models

- **Abstraction**: Simplifies reality by including only relevant features.
- **Input Data**: Based on historical data and assumptions.
- **Output**: Predictions or decisions about future events or behaviors.

---

## Real-world Implications

- **Decision-making**: Models influence significant decisions in finance, education, justice, and other fields.
- **Automation**: Increasing reliance on automated systems for efficiency and scalability.
- **Accountability**: The need for transparency and ethical considerations.

# What Makes a Good Model?

---

## Example: Baseball Statistics

- **Transparency**: Everyone has access to the data and the methods used.
- **Relevance**: Uses directly relevant data such as balls, strikes, and hits.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuously updated with new data and tested for accuracy.
- **Statistical Rigor**: Relies on a large amount of relevant data, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.

---

## Baseball Statistics: An Effective Model

- **Historical Data**: Uses comprehensive and relevant historical data.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Considers numerous variables such as player performance in different situations.
- **Constant Updates**: Models are updated daily with new game data.
- **Clear Metrics**: Metrics like batting averages and strike rates are well understood and directly relevant to game outcomes.

---

## Characteristics of a Good Model

- **Accurate**: Produces reliable predictions.
- **Fair**: Applies equally to all individuals or situations.
- **Transparent**: Understandable and explainable to users.
- **Dynamic**: Continuously updated with new information.

---

## Benefits of Good Models

- **Enhanced Decision-making**: Better predictions lead to better decisions.
- **Trust and Accountability**: Transparency builds trust and allows for accountability.
- **Adaptability**: Dynamic models can adapt to new data and changing conditions.

---

# What Makes a Bad Model?

---

## Example: Prison Recidivism

- **Opaque**: The workings of the model are hidden and not understandable to most people.
- **Biased Data**: Includes prejudicial assumptions, such as race affecting recidivism predictions.
- **Static**: Not regularly updated or tested against reality.
- **Unfair**: Disproportionately affects certain groups, reinforcing existing inequalities.

---

## Prison Recidivism: A Problematic Model

- **Hidden Assumptions**: Relies on factors that may not be relevant or fair, like race or socioeconomic background.
- **Lack of Transparency**: The algorithms and their inputs are not disclosed to those affected.
- **Unaccountable**: No feedback loop to correct errors or biases in the model.
- **Discriminatory Impact**: Often leads to harsher sentences for minorities based on flawed predictions.

---

## Characteristics of a Bad Model

- **Inaccurate**: Produces unreliable or harmful predictions.
- **Biased**: Reflects and reinforces human prejudices.
- **Opaque**: Lack of transparency and accountability.
- **Static**: Fails to update with new data or feedback.

---

## Dangers of Bad Models

- **Reinforces Inequality**: Exacerbates existing social and economic disparities.
- **Lack of Redress**: Individuals have little recourse against incorrect or unfair decisions.
- **Erosion of Trust**: Lack of transparency leads to distrust in systems and institutions.
- **Self-Perpetuating**: Faulty models can create feedback loops that perpetuate their own biases and errors.

# Case Studies: Good vs. Bad Models

---

## Good Model: Baseball Statistics

- **Scenario**: Managers use statistical models to decide player positioning and game strategy.
- **Data**: Includes detailed records of player performance over time.
- **Outcome**: Increases the likelihood of successful plays and wins.
- **Transparency**: Fans and analysts have access to the same data and can understand decisions.

---

## Bad Model: Teacher Evaluation

- **Scenario**: Washington, D.C. schools use a value-added model to evaluate teachers.
- **Data**: Based heavily on student test scores.
- **Outcome**: Good teachers like Sarah Wysocki are unfairly fired due to flawed metrics.
- **Opaque**: Teachers and the public do not have access to understand or contest the scores.

---

# Conclusion

---

## Key Takeaways

- Models are powerful tools that can influence many aspects of life.
- A good model is accurate, fair, transparent, and dynamic.
- A bad model is inaccurate, biased, opaque, and static.
- Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of models is crucial for their responsible use.
