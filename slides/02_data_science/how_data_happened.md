# The History of Data

![bg right:40%](./slides/july_01_am/18th_century_crime_statistics.jpg)

## Early Beginnings

- In the 18th century, as empires expanded and governance became more complex, rulers needed a way to understand their domains.
- They began recording data on population, land, and resources.
- **"Statistics" was a term that initially meant knowledge about the state**.

## The Birth of Social Physics

- Early 19th century: Belgian astronomer **Adolphe Quetelet** applied statistical methods to society.
- Introduced the concept of the **"average man"**.
- Developed the **Body Mass Index (BMI)**.
- Quetelet's work laid the foundation for **social physics**, aiming to reveal societal patterns and norms through data.

## The Dark Turn: Eugenics

- **Francis Galton**, cousin of Charles Darwin, expanded on Quetelet's ideas.
- Fascinated by heredity and human improvement.
- Introduced concepts of **regression** and **correlation**.
- His work led to the **eugenics** movement, advocating for selective breeding to improve human genetics.

## Data Shaping Policy

- Early 20th century: Data became a tool for policymakers.
- Governments used data for informed decisions on education, military, and social policies.
- **Intelligence testing** guided educational and military placements, reflecting the belief in data's power to shape society.

## Public Health Policy in NYC

- Early 20th century: Tuberculosis (TB) was a major issue in New York City.
- Department of Health, led by Commissioner Hermann Biggs, used data to combat TB.
  - **Mandatory Reporting**: Physicians and hospitals required to report TB cases.
  - **Dispensaries and Sanatoriums**: Provided medical care and reduced transmission.
  - **Public Health Campaigns**: Educated public on TB prevention.
  - **Housing Reforms**: Improved ventilation and reduced overcrowding in tenement buildings.
- Efforts significantly reduced TB rates and became a model for other cities.

## Formalizing Data Science

- Data science began to formalize in the early 20th century.
- New **mathematical and statistical techniques** emerged.
- Transformed data analysis into a rigorous scientific discipline.
- Marked the **birth of data science** as a recognized field.

## Data at War

- **World War II** showcased the critical role of data in military operations.
- Statisticians and data analysts contributed to **codebreaking** and strategic planning.
- Innovations from wartime propelled data science forward post-war, influencing technology and industry.

## Alan Turing and the Enigma Machine

- **Alan Turing**, a mathematician and logician, played a crucial role in breaking the Enigma code.
- The Enigma machine was used by Nazi Germany to encrypt military communications.
- Turing's work at Bletchley Park involved using **data and statistical methods** to crack the Enigma cipher.
- Developed the **Bombe machine**, which significantly accelerated the decryption process.
- Breaking the Enigma code provided the Allies with critical intelligence, shortening the war and saving countless lives.
- This achievement highlighted the power of data and statistics in solving complex problems.

## The Age of Big Data

- Late 20th and early 21st centuries: Era of **Big Data**.
- Defined by **volume, variety, and velocity**.
- Transformed industries with technological advancements in storage and processing.
- Created opportunities and challenges in fields like healthcare and marketing.

<!-- _footer: "7. Chapter 8: Volume, Variety, and Velocity" -->

---

## Machine Learning and AI

- **Machine learning** revolutionized data science.
- **Machine learning algorithms** transformed industries with powerful prediction and analysis tools.
- Opened new frontiers in **artificial intelligence**, raising both potential and ethical concerns.

## Discussion

### Reflect on the Evolution of Data Science

- How have historical figures like Quetelet and Galton shaped the way we understand data today?
- Consider the impact of wartime data practices on modern data science.
- What ethical considerations should guide the future of data science and machine learning?
