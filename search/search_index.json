While different fields, they work best in sync to help change the way humans think, behave, and interact. In fact, some of the most popular data science methods stem from machine learning. Through this course, students will be introduced to the foundations of both science areas and explore available career opportunities. Beginning with an overview of the landscape and real-world applications, students will learn how data science and machine learning impact the world in which we live, every day. Further, students will gain hands-on experience with introductory coding using Python and become versed in popular machine learning algorithms. By the end of the course, students will use their benchmark knowledge to analyze and present data ethically and effectively. Finally, students will leave the course prepared for more advanced practice in data science and machine learning.</p> <p>Note: This course is for students with little-to-no previous experience with coding/programming. Students with more advanced knowledge should consider Data Science and Machine Learning II.</p>"},{"location":"#morning-session","title":"Morning Session","text":"<ul> <li>MTWRF 11:10am-1:00pm</li> <li>825 Seeley W.

These exercises will be based on the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Hello World</li> <li>Simple Calculator</li> <li>The Guessing Game</li> <li>The Fibonacci Sequence</li> </ul> <p>Building a Text Adventure Game</p> <p>Students will build a simple text adventure game in Python. This will be an exercise in using control flow, functions, and data structures. Later in the course, students will revisit this project to introduce Machine Learning concepts.</p> <p>CSV Data Analysis</p> <p>Students will work with CSV files to analyze data. This will be an exercise in using data structures and Pandas. Primarily, students will be working with housing data but, as we progress, we will introduce new datasets based on the interests of the students.</p> <p>Natural Language Processing with Music Lyrics</p> <p>Students will work with music lyrics to:</p> <ul> <li>Analyze sentiment</li> <li>Separate music by artist using TFIDF</li> </ul> <p>Time Series Data Analysis</p> <p>Students will work with time series data to predict future values. This will be an exercise in using linear regressions and will later be revisited to demonstrate train-test splits.</p> <p>Image Classification with Pytorch</p> <p>Students will use Pytorch to classify images. At least one exercise will involve classifying handwritten digits. The second exercise will depend on the interests of the students.</p>"},{"location":"scratch/#week-1-python","title":"Week 1: Python","text":"<p>Day 1 Monday, June 24th</p> <p>Morning Session Topics
